## SupScript
(ignore bad english i rushed this entire documention)
What is it?
Well I, Supereo, make games because thats what I like doing! and games such as Minecraft have the ability to make plugins with java that you can use on servers to customize how the game looks, feels and works! So, I was like hmmm, i want people to customize my game and i want to try and make my own programming langauge, so that exactly what i did. In conclusion SupScript is a little programming language that allows you to make addons for my games such as multiworld, you will also soon be able to make your own games inside of the Supereo Game Lab Ide!
Like the sound of it so far? Read on then!
